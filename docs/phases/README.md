# Development Phases

Final product name: FluxSQL.

Repository strategy: clean monorepo, no imported Git history.

Backend decision: NestJS for the cloud API.

Desktop decision: fully functional without login. Login only enables cloud sync.

MVP database safety scope: PostgreSQL for backup and sandbox. Other engines may be inspected and used for synthetic generation earlier, but serious safe migration starts with PostgreSQL.

## Detailed Companions

- [Salvage inventory](../salvage-inventory.md): exact map of what is preserved from each rescued source.
- [Functional MVP checklist](../functional-mvp-checklist.md): concrete work needed to turn the rescued code into a working app.

## Product Rules

- FluxSQL cloud never receives database credentials.
- FluxSQL cloud never receives backups, dumps or private query results.
- Desktop works offline.
- Direct writes to real databases are blocked by default.
- Risky actions require policy, backup, sandbox and human approval when applicable.
- Skills are free in the first version and managed through app storage, not a root source folder.
- Team Safety monetizes governance, policies, approvals, audit and private distribution, not basic skill access.
